              The ExO Canvas was created by a group of ExO practitioners from
              around the world during a co-creation process that took a few
              months and was released in March 2016. To continuously improving
              this great tool, the ExO Canvas is being managed as a software
              piece. Every few months, a new version of the ExO Canvas will be
              released based on the feedback received by the ExO Canvas
              Community.
